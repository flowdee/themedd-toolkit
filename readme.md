# Themedd Toolkit

This is my very personal toolkit plugin for building websites based on [Themedd](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/themedd).

## Features

This plugin is a collection of often used enhancements which can be enabled/disabled individually via a settings page. Very handy for running multiple (different) projects.

### Credits

This plugin is **not** official made or maintained by the team behind _Themedd_. It's built by [flowdee](https://twitter.com/flowdee). 

You like my work? [Support me](https://donate.flowdee.de/) or not. I don't mind, as long as I was able to help you :wink:
